# CodeWithJava21

This repository contains code examples for "Code with Java 21" by Aaron Ploetz (BPB Publishing). The specific chapters supported here are chapters 2 -> 7 and chapter 9.

## Requirements

 - Java 21
 - Maven
 - Run from within an IDE.

All sample code works off of a single pom.xml, which is found at the root directory. Because of this, and the many `main()` methods within, running a single chapter's code from the command line can prove difficult to do. Therefore, the code in this repostory is meant to be run from within an IDE, such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, or VSCode.
